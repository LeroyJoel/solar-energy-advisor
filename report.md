**Solar Advisory Report for a Typical Nigerian Household**

**1. Introduction:**

This report outlines a solar energy solution for a typical Nigerian household, comparing the costs and benefits against continued reliance on a petrol/diesel generator.  The analysis is based on estimated energy consumption and current market prices in Nigeria.  A detailed site assessment is crucial for precise system sizing and cost estimation.

**2. Estimated Energy Consumption:**

Based on the provided data, the estimated monthly energy consumption for a typical Nigerian household is approximately 204.3 kWh.  This is based on a range of appliances with typical usage patterns and does not account for seasonal variations (e.g., increased AC use during hotter months) or variations in appliance efficiency.

**3. Recommended Solar System Design:**

To meet the estimated monthly energy consumption of 204.3 kWh, we recommend an off-grid solar system with the following components:

* **Inverter:** 5 kVA (to handle approximately 4 kW of DC power input)
* **Solar Panels:** 10 x 400W monocrystalline panels (total 4 kW)
* **Batteries:**  Two options are considered:
    * **Lead-Acid:**  A bank of lead-acid batteries with approximately 13.58 kWh capacity (50% DoD) is needed. The precise number and configuration of batteries will depend on voltage and Ah ratings of individual batteries and would be determined during a site assessment by a qualified installer.
    * **Lithium-ion:** A bank of lithium-ion batteries with approximately 8.49 kWh capacity (80% DoD).  Again, a site assessment will precisely define the battery configuration.
* **Charge Controller:** MPPT charge controller matched to the solar panel output.
* **Wiring, Connectors, and Mounting Hardware:** Suitable for safe and efficient installation.
* **Protection Devices:** Circuit breakers, fuses, and surge protectors.


**4. Cost Breakdown (₦):**

The following cost estimates are based on average market prices in Nigeria and may vary.  These are *ranges* to reflect this variability, and multiple quotes from reputable suppliers should be obtained.  Installation costs are estimates.

| Component                      | Quantity | Unit Price Range (₦) | Total Price Range (₦) |
|---------------------------------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| 400W Monocrystalline Solar Panels | 10        | 150,000 - 200,000       | 1,500,000 - 2,000,000   |
| 5 kVA Inverter                 | 1        | 250,000 - 400,000       | 250,000 - 400,000     |
| Lead-Acid Battery Bank (est.)   | (Multiple)| 50,000 - 80,000 per unit | 300,000 - 800,000      |
| Lithium-ion Battery Bank (est.) | (Multiple)| 400,000 - 700,000 per unit | 1,200,000 - 2,100,000   |
| MPPT Charge Controller          | 1        | 50,000 - 100,000      | 50,000 - 100,000      |
| Wiring, etc.                   | -        | 50,000 - 100,000      | 50,000 - 100,000      |
| Installation                    | -        | 200,000 - 300,000      | 200,000 - 300,000      |
| **Total (Lead-Acid)**           |           |                       | **2,850,000 - 4,200,000** |
| **Total (Lithium-ion)**        |           |                       | **4,500,000 - 6,400,000** |


**5. Generator vs. Solar Cost Comparison:**

To illustrate the cost savings, let's consider a typical generator scenario:

* **Generator Fuel:** Assume a 5 kVA petrol generator consuming 1 liter of petrol per hour at a cost of ₦500 per liter (prices vary widely).
* **Daily Running Hours:** Assuming 6 hours of daily generator use (due to power outages), the daily fuel cost is ₦3000 (6 hours * ₦500/hour).
* **Monthly Fuel Cost:** The monthly fuel cost is ₦90,000 (₦3000/day * 30 days).

**Annual Generator Cost:** ₦1,080,000 (₦90,000/month * 12 months).  This is a considerable expense.  Maintenance and eventual replacement of the generator also adds cost.

**Annual Solar Cost (Estimated):** Assuming a 10-year lifespan for the system (Lithium-ion batteries have longer lifespans), and a ₦5,000,000 system cost, the annual amortized cost is ₦500,000. This does not include yearly maintenance, which is significantly less than a generator.

**Savings:**  In the first year alone, switching to solar could save roughly ₦580,000 (₦1,080,000 - ₦500,000).  Over 10 years, the savings are substantial, even considering battery replacement.


**6. Financing Options:**

Several financing options exist: cooperative loans, bank loans, and PAYGo systems.  Each has varying interest rates, repayment periods, and eligibility criteria.  Thorough comparison is necessary.


**7. Recommendation:**

Switching to a solar power system represents a long-term cost-saving and environmentally friendly solution. The higher initial cost of a solar system (especially Lithium-ion), is offset by significant long-term fuel savings and reduced reliance on fluctuating fuel prices.   Obtain multiple quotes for both the system and financing.  A qualified installer should conduct a site assessment to finalize the system design and obtain the most accurate cost estimate.  The choice between lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries should be made based on budget and long-term cost considerations.
